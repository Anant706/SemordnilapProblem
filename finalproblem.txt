Using test first development, write the program described below.

A text file contains several lines of lowercase text. Write a program that reads the file and prints the number of Semordnilap that are in it.

For the purpose of this program, a Semordnilap is defined as a word, of length greater than one, where the word is of correct spelling and the reverse of the word is also a correct spelling for a different word.

For example, if the file contains the text

some things are evil mom
                      
The result is:

Number of Semordnilap is 2.

End of output.

mom is not a Semordnilap as it does not spell as a different word in reverse.

The program can find if the spelling for a word is correct by using the 
service:
http://agile.cs.uh.edu/spell?check=WORD where WORD can be substituted
with the actual word/string.

Design the program in a way that 
-we may use a different service to check the spelling in the future
-we may read the text from another source instead of a file

Code coverage [10]: -2

Coverage report not showing up any coverage. The 
getClassDirectories().setFrom(files(classDirectories.files.map {
part added to build.gradle.kts is messing with this.

SpellCheckerService's spellChecker is doing things beyond its responsibility, lacking cohesion, violating SRP.

Code Quality [10]: -2
Use modern API to read content of file.
SpellCheckerProvider spellChecker should be checkSpelling or isSpellingCorrect
